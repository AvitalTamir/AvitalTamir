## Hi, my name is Avital Tamir 👋

- 👨‍💻 I work as a Software Engineer at [groundcover](https://www.groundcover.com)
- 👷 I'm building [Cyphernetes](https://github.com/AvitalTamir/cyphernetes), a graph query language for Kubernetes
- 🤖 I love creating AI-facing tools and making models dogfood on while developing such as [Memora](https://github.com/AvitalTamir/memora) and the [Sever programming language](https://github.com/AvitalTamir/sever)
- 🧁 On occasion, I'll release a retina-scorching VSCode theme like [purddy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cyphernetes.purddy) or [aquamelon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cyphernetes.aquamelon)
